## This is a simple web page that says "I love you".

The HTML file contains a link to the CSS file and a paragraph with the text "I LOVE YOU".

The CSS file imports the Poppins font from Google Fonts and sets the font family, font size, font weight, padding, position, letter spacing, and color of the paragraph.

The CSS file also adds a pseudo-element to the paragraph that contains the text "I love you". The pseudo-element is positioned absolutely, has the same padding as the paragraph, and has a clip-path that animates from a triangle to a square.
